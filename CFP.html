                Software engineers need to acquire a rich set of soft (<i>e.g.</i> problem-solving) and hard skills (<i>e.g.</i> software testing) in order to be able to deliver 
                high-quality software systems that meet stakeholders' needs. Such a skill set can be acquired through different educational and training means: from formal education 
                in schools and universities to workplace training and capstone projects, from offline classes to those online, from coding clubs to boot camps and contests, up to 
                the use of any resource or technology for the education and training of present and future software engineers. These educational and training means need to be 
                assessed by educators or trainers. To do so, it is needed to compare the desired or expected learning outcomes with the actual results. LEARNER 2023 is a workshop 
                interested in any aspect concerning the evaluation and assessment of educational and training means for present and future software engineers. Contributions aiming 
                to evaluate and assess the skills above-mentioned, as well as engagement and retention (<i>e.g.</i> gender balance) in the education and training of software 
                engineers, are also of interest to the workshop.

                <b>Paper format</b>
                <br/>
                The authors have four options for submitting their papers:
                <ul style="margin-left:2%;">
                    <li><b>Research paper</b> (max 10 pages). They must describe empirical research (<i>i.e.,</i> quantitative, qualitative, and mixed research)
                           on topics related to software engineers' education and training (see Topics). Negative-results papers are welcome as long as they can support advice 
                           or lessons learned. Papers reporting replications of empirical studies are welcome as well.</li>
                    <li><b>Experience-report paper</b> (max 5 pages). They must describe an experience on topics related to software engineers' education and training.
                           Unlike research papers, experience-report ones do not leverage empirical research (<i>i.e.,</i> quantitative, qualitative, and mixed research)
                           to distill findings. Experience-report papers are on interest as long as they provide an interpretation of the experience in terms of 
                           lessons learned and actionable tips. The topics of interest are those listed in Topics.</li>
                    <li><b>Ongoing-research paper</b> (max 5 pages). They must describe ongoing research on topics related to software engineers' education and training 
                            (see Topics). The purpose of these papers is to communicate new ideas in the context of software engineers' education and training for which 
                            the authors want to obtain early feedback from the workshop community, especially on the evaluation and assessment strategies. An ongoing-research
                            paper must describe the idea as well as the proposed evaluation and assessment strategy possibly (but not necessarily) with some preliminary results. 
                            For example, an ongoing-research paper can present a software tool for education and training purposes of software engineers along with the planned
                            evaluation and assessment strategy.</li>
                    <li><b>Methodological-failure paper</b> (max 5 pages). They are papers where poor evaluation and assessment strategies invalidate otherwise interesting findings 
                           in the context of software engineers' education and training. A methodological-failure paper must discuss the flaws of evaluation and assessment strategies 
                           as well as the findings. The topics of interest are those listed in Topics.</li>
                    </ul>

                <b>Paper submission and pubblication</b>
                <br/>
                The page limit (we reported above) for each kind of submission is intended for the entire paper &mdash; <i>i.e.,</i> it includes references, figures, 
                tables, appendices, and any other additional material. Any submission exceeding the corresponding page limit will be desk-rejected.
                LEARNER 2023 will employ a double-blind review process. Any paper must be written in English, contain original unpublished work, and use the official 
                ACM Primary Article Template (<a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>) 
                as the main <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/ease-2023">EASE</a>. Deviating from the ACM formatting instructions may lead to desk rejection. 
                Papers must be submitted in PDF format through EasyChar at: <a href="#">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=learner2023</a>. Accepted papers will 
                be published in the joint workshop proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop and 
                present the paper.

                            The report includes an overview of the limitations of background work on different versions of android, the possibilities of circumventing them and performing tasks in the background in principle, as well as existing tools for this. </p>

                            From this report you will learn about what complex code is and what affects the complexity of its perception. You will learn what cyclomatic complexity of programs is and what metrics are used to evaluate code complexity. </p>

                            We will consider what BDD testing is and how it helps to write E2E tests cheaper and faster. Using Gherkin syntax in conjunction with Cypress, we will consider how to make tests understandable not only for developers, but also for testers with managers. </p>
